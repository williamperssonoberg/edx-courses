    <h2>Guitar practice</h2>
    <p>First on my daily schedule is to practice guitar. I usually practice between 30 to 60 minutes a day. More if I have an upcoming show or if I am working on new songs.</p>

    <h2>Studying</h2>
    <p>Thirdly, I try to study for a couple of hours every day. Depending on what I am studying of course.</p>
    <p>Currently I am studying web programming through a website called <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edx.org</a> and with an app called <em><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank">Sololearn</a></em>. I find it very useful to study in several different mediums.</p>
